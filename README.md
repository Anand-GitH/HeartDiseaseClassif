# HeartDiseaseClassif
Classification – Using Neural Network, CART, Random Forest

Dataset: Cleveland Heart Disease Study
296 observations and 15 variables

Response Variable: diag1
Buff- not sick with heart disease
Sick-sick with heart disease

Built Classification tree, random forest,neural network and deep neural network models.

Neural network is efficient given input dataset is large as it’s a slow learner and computationally
intensive. But its complex to interpret as its black box model due to number of layers and number of
parameters it makes model difficult to understand and interpret compared to CART and Random Forest.
